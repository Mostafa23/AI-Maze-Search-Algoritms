# Maze Navigation AI üöÄ

This project implements AI algorithms to solve maze navigation problems. The program explores and finds optimal paths in a given maze using the following algorithms:

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**  
3. **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**  

The goal is to navigate a maze from the start to the target while demonstrating how each algorithm operates and performs.

## Algorithms Implemented ‚öôÔ∏è

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)  
- Explores all possible paths level by level.  
- Guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted maze.  

### Depth-First Search (DFS)  
- Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.  
- Does not guarantee the shortest path.  

### Uniform Cost Search (UCS)  
- Explores paths in order of cumulative cost.  
- Guarantees the optimal path in a weighted maze.
